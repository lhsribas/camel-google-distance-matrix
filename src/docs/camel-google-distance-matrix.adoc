= Camel Google Distance Matrix

The Camel Google Distance Matrix provides a mechanism to calculate the distance between geolocation, to provide a better
consuming of the Distance Matrix API this component implements the Haversine's algorithm to filter the geolocation.

== Distance Matrix API

The Distance Matrix API is a service that provides travel distance and time for a matrix of origins and destinations,
based on the recommended route between start and end points.

== Haversine's Formula

Haversine's formula is an important equation used in navigation, providing distances between two points of a sphere
from their latitudes and longitudes. It is a special case of a more general formula for spherical trigonometry,
the Haversines Law, relating the sides to angles of a "triangular" sphere.
